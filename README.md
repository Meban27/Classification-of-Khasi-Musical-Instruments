# Extracting-features-of-Khasi-Musical-Instruments

This repository is primarily for educational purposes, containing the code used by Group #2 of the NEHU B.Tech 2020-24 batch for their final semester project. The project, focused on the classification of Khasi musical instruments, is conducted by the following students:

1. Mebanpynshai Lyngdoh Marshilong (21BtechLECE07)
2. Moirangthem Bhorot Singh (20BTechECE)
3. Yongyo HM (21BtechLECE01)

## Project Overview
The primary aim of this project is to bring Khasi musical instruments into the technological realm, a domain where they have been largely overlooked. By analyzing and classifying these instruments, we hope to promote their rich cultural heritage and encourage further academic and technological exploration.

## Datasets
Due to an agreement with the Department of Culture and Creative, NEHU Shillong, the datasets used in this project are not included in this repository. We invite interested students to enhance this work by collecting more datasets of Khasi musical instruments and contributing innovative ideas to further refine and improve the project.

## Contributions
This project is developed for non-profit purposes. It should not be used for personal gain but instead to foster further development and contributions to the field. We encourage contributions that can expand the scope and depth of this project. If you have new data, algorithms, or other improvements, please feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.

## Future Work
This project is a foundational step towards integrating Khasi musical instruments with modern technology. We hope that it will inspire future research and development efforts. Potential areas for future work include:

- Expanding the dataset with more diverse and comprehensive samples.
- Improving the classification algorithms for better accuracy.
- Developing interactive applications or interfaces for Khasi musical instruments.
- We look forward to seeing how this work can be built upon and improved in the years to come.
